I am currently learning GPU computing, seeking to broaden my expertise to make use of GPU's highly parallelized structure.

I also have extensive experience in FTC/FLL FIRST competitions, having been a part of team FTC 10738 and FLL 27743, and continuing to mentor FIRST teams.

I run the websites https://stemrobotics4all.org, which is a site of resources for FLL/FTC teams both rookie and advanced, as well as https://latinfolk.org, a site celebrating Romanian and latin folk music.

I speak Romanian, French, Spanish, and English, learning Hungarian, Russian, Hebrew, and Arabic, and am always happy to contribute to localizations of apps, websites, or services.
