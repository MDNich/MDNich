### Hello :)

I am an aspring Aerospace Engineer, currently enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I enjoy many aspects of engineering, physics, math, linguistics, and CS. I am proficient in Python, Java, Matlab, and Swift.

I often perform data analysis tasks relating to scientific research. You can find my published papers here: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5330-2676

I am currently learning GPU computing, seeking to broaden my expertise to make use of GPU's highly parallelized structure.

I also have extensive experience in FTC/FLL FIRST competitions, having been a part of team FTC 10738 and FLL 27743, and continuing to mentor FIRST teams.

I speak Romanian, French, Spanish, and English, learning Hungarian and Russian, and am always happy to contribute to localizations of apps, websites, or services.

Thank you !
